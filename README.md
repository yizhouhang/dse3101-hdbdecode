# Overview 
Buying or selling an HDB flat in Singapore comes with various challenges. 
Users interested in specific units often struggle to determine a fair market price, as listing platforms typically reflect inflated asking prices rather than actual transaction values‚Äîespecially in non-seller‚Äôs markets. For general buyers, the process can be overwhelming due to the number of factors to consider, such as budget,location,flat type, nearby amenities,etc.
With information scattered across multiple sources, it‚Äôs difficult for users to make confident, informed decisions.
